# Random data benchmarks

This simply runs benchmarks on random data as a lower boundary.
To run the benchmarks, generate the test data as described in `data`.
Then, call the `measure.sh` script to run the benchmarks.

The pileup files generated by `generate_pileup.sh` have simulated coverages in the range 10-500 base pairs.
For computing the pool-seq corrected diversity metrics, they hence have a relatively low range of coverages,
so that the computation of the demoninators (which needs to be done once for each coverage)
is saturated relatively quickly. Hence, this test is mostly concerned with the overall reading and processing speed.

The sync files generated by `data/generate_sync.sh` also serve the same purpose, and are relatively low coverage.
