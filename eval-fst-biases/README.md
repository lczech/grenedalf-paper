# Examination of the biases in existing estimators of FST

Here, we evaluate the overestimation of FST caused by the Kofler and Karlsson estimators of FST for Pool-seq samples, compared to their true values based on simulation. We further show that the unbiased Nei and Hudson estimators do not suffer from this overestimation.

The tests conducted here are shown in our [equations document](https://github.com/lczech/pool-seq-pop-gen-stats). See there for a detailed explanation of the simulations, and the resulting plots.
