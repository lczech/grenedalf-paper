# grenedalf-paper
Code for tests and benchmarks of our paper on grenedalf

We here provide tests scripts to benchmark grenedalf against PoPoolation 1 and 2.
For these tests to run, you need to make sure that all tools in `software` are
working, and in particular compile grenedalf first.
Then, generate the random test data as described in `data`.
Lastly, call the `measure.sh` script to run the benchmarks.
